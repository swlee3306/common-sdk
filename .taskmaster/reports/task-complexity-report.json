			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Compression (gzip, lz4)",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of gzip and lz4 compression into separate subtasks, including configuration, implementation in sending/receiving paths, and error handling for each algorithm.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing two compression algorithms and integrating them into the message flow requires careful planning and execution. Configuration and error handling add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Message Encryption (AES-256)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the AES-256 encryption implementation into key generation, encryption/decryption logic, GCM implementation, and security audit preparation.",
			"reasoning": "Encryption is a security-sensitive task. Key management, GCM implementation, and the need for security audits increase the complexity significantly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Prometheus Metrics Collection",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the Prometheus integration into defining metrics, implementing the `/metrics` endpoint, implementing middleware, and creating dashboards.",
			"reasoning": "Defining relevant metrics, implementing the endpoint, and creating dashboards require a good understanding of the system and Prometheus."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Structured Logging (JSON)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down structured logging into library selection/configuration, log format definition, implementation across the codebase, and integration with a log aggregation system.",
			"reasoning": "Choosing a logging library, defining a consistent format, and integrating with a log aggregation system require coordination and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Health Check Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the health check implementation into endpoint creation, dependency health checks, and error handling/reporting.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a basic health check endpoint is relatively straightforward, but checking dependencies and providing detailed information adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Retry Logic and Backoff Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate the retry logic implementation into library integration, configuration of retry parameters, implementation for specific operations, and logging of retry attempts.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing retry logic with backoff requires careful configuration and integration with specific operations that are prone to errors."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement API Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide API documentation into code commenting, documentation generation, and example creation/validation.",
			"reasoning": "Generating API documentation is relatively straightforward, but writing good comments and creating useful examples requires effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unit Tests and Integration Tests",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down testing into unit tests for specific modules, integration tests for key workflows, code coverage analysis, and CI/CD integration.",
			"reasoning": "Writing comprehensive unit and integration tests, achieving high code coverage, and integrating with a CI/CD pipeline require significant effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Connection Pooling and Reuse",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide connection pooling into library integration, configuration, connection acquisition/release logic, and connection closing/cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing connection pooling requires careful configuration and management of connections to avoid resource leaks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling Enhancement",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate error handling enhancement into defining a consistent strategy, implementing custom error types, improving error logging, and implementing error recovery mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Improving error handling requires a consistent strategy and careful implementation of custom error types and recovery mechanisms."
